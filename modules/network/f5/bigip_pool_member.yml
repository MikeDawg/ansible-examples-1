# The BIG-IP GUI doesn't map directly to the API calls for "Pool ->
# Members -> State". The following states map to API monitor
# and session states.
#
# Enabled (all traffic allowed):
# monitor_state=enabled, session_state=enabled
# Disabled (only persistent or active connections allowed):
# monitor_state=enabled, session_state=disabled
# Forced offline (only active connections allowed):
# monitor_state=disabled, session_state=disabled
#
