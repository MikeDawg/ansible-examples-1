# This example adds a rule to redirect queries from a specific user to another
# hostgroup, it saves the mysql query rule config to disk, but avoids loading
# the mysql query config config to runtime (this might be because several
# rules are being added and the user wants to push the config to runtime in a
# single batch using the M(proxysql_manage_config) module). It uses supplied
# credentials to connect to the proxysql admin interface.

# This example removes all rules that use the username 'guest_ro', saves the
# mysql query rule config to disk, and dynamically loads the mysql query rule
# config to runtime.  It uses credentials in a supplied config file to connect
# to the proxysql admin interface.
