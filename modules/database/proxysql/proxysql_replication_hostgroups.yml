# This example adds a replication hostgroup, it saves the mysql server config
# to disk, but avoids loading the mysql server config to runtime (this might be
# because several replication hostgroup are being added and the user wants to
# push the config to runtime in a single batch using the
# M(proxysql_manage_config) module).  It uses supplied credentials to connect
# to the proxysql admin interface.

# This example removes a replication hostgroup, saves the mysql server config
