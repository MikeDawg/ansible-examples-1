# This example adds a user, it saves the mysql user config to disk, but
# avoids loading the mysql user config to runtime (this might be because
# several users are being added and the user wants to push the config to
# runtime in a single batch using the M(proxysql_manage_config) module).  It
# uses supplied credentials to connect to the proxysql admin interface.

# This example removes a user, saves the mysql user config to disk, and
