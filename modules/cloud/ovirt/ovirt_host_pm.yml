# Examples don't contain auth parameter for simplicity,
# look at ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication:

# Add fence agent to host 'myhost'
- ovirt_host_pm:
    name: myhost
    address: 1.2.3.4
    options:
      myoption1: x
      myoption2: y
    username: admin
    password: admin
    port: 3333
    type: ipmilan

# Remove ipmilan fence agent with address 1.2.3.4 on host 'myhost'
- ovirt_host_pm:
    state: absent
    name: myhost
    address: 1.2.3.4
    type: ipmilan
