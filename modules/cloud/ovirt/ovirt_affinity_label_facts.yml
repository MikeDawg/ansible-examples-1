# Examples don't contain auth parameter for simplicity,
# look at ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication:

# Gather facts about all affinity labels, which names start with C(label):
- ovirt_affinity_label_facts:
    name: label*
- debug:
    var: affinity_labels

# Gather facts about all affinity labels, which are assigned to VMs
# which names start with C(postgres):
- ovirt_affinity_label_facts:
    vm: postgres*
- debug:
    var: affinity_labels

# Gather facts about all affinity labels, which are assigned to hosts
# which names start with C(west):
- ovirt_affinity_label_facts:
    host: west*
- debug:
    var: affinity_labels

# Gather facts about all affinity labels, which are assigned to hosts
# which names start with C(west) or VMs which names start with C(postgres):
- ovirt_affinity_label_facts:
    host: west*
    vm: postgres*
- debug:
    var: affinity_labels
