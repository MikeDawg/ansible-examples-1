# Examples don't contain auth parameter for simplicity,
# look at ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication:

# Create bond on eth0 and eth1 interface, and put 'myvlan' network on top of it:
- name: Bonds
  ovirt_host_networks:
    name: myhost
    bond:
      name: bond0
      mode: 2
      interfaces:
        - eth1
        - eth2
    networks:
      - name: myvlan
        boot_protocol: static
        address: 1.2.3.4
        prefix: 24
        gateway: 1.2.3.4
        version: v4

# Remove bond0 bond from host interfaces:
- ovirt_host_networks:
    state: absent
    name: myhost
    bond:
      name: bond0

# Assign myvlan1 and myvlan2 vlans to host eth0 interface:
- ovirt_host_networks:
    name: myhost
    interface: eth0
    networks:
      - name: myvlan1
      - name: myvlan2

# Remove myvlan2 vlan from host eth0 interface:
- ovirt_host_networks:
    state: absent
    name: myhost
    interface: eth0
    networks:
      - name: myvlan2

# Remove all networks/vlans from host eth0 interface:
- ovirt_host_networks:
    state: absent
    name: myhost
    interface: eth0
