# Examples don't contain auth parameter for simplicity,
# look at ovirt_auth module to see how to reuse authentication:

# Gather facts about all hosts which names start with C(host) and
# belong to data center C(west):
- ovirt_hosts_facts:
    pattern: name=host* and datacenter=west
- debug:
    var: ovirt_hosts
