# Allow everything and enable UFW
- ufw:
    state: enabled
    policy: allow

# Set logging
- ufw:
    logging: on

# Sometimes it is desirable to let the sender know when traffic is
# being denied, rather than simply ignoring it. In these cases, use
# reject instead of deny. In addition, log rejected connections:
- ufw:
    rule: reject
    port: auth
    log: yes

# ufw supports connection rate limiting, which is useful for protecting
# against brute-force login attacks. ufw will deny connections if an IP
# address has attempted to initiate 6 or more connections in the last
# 30 seconds. See  http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/187
# for details. Typical usage is:
- ufw:
    rule: limit
    port: ssh
    proto: tcp

# Allow OpenSSH. (Note that as ufw manages its own state, simply removing
# a rule=allow task can leave those ports exposed. Either use delete=yes
# or a separate state=reset task)
- ufw:
    rule: allow
    name: OpenSSH

# Delete OpenSSH rule
- ufw:
    rule: allow
    name: OpenSSH
    delete: yes
